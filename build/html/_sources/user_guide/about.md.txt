# About

Colada is a desktop platform that utilizes full power of C++, python and julia 
to make geological/geophysical data processing effective, fast and robust. 
Currently it only supports data visuzalization and seismic wavemodeling/migration/inversion. 

Most functionality is implemented through extensions and modules.
Many open source projects are involved and more are yet going to be involved. 

Built on top of [Slicer 3D](https://www.slicer.org/)
